D013629_D001943 NONE There is no difference in <e2>breast-cancer</e2> frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and <e1>tamoxifen</e1> ( 19 ) arms .
D013629_D001943 NONE There is a statistically significant reduction of <e2>breast cancer</e2> among women receiving <e1>tamoxifen</e1> who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen .

D014700_D001281 CID RESULTS : <e1>Verapamil</e1> caused <e2>AF</e2> promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing , from 8+/-4 s ( mean+/-S.E. ) to 95+/-39 s ( P<0.01 vs. control ) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s ( P<0.0005 vs. control ) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg .

D014700_D001281 CID In these experiments , <e1>verapamil</e1> shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms ( P<0.02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1 % , P<0.05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of <e2>AF</e2> ( 94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms , P<0.005 ) .

D014148_D012640 CID High-dose <e1>tranexamic Acid</e1> is associated with nonischemic clinical <e2>seizures</e2> in cardiac surgical patients .
D014148_D012640 CID The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between <e1>TXA</e1> usage and <e2>seizures</e2> after cardiac surgery .
D014148_D012640 CID All 24 patients with <e2>seizures</e2> received high doses of <e1>TXA</e1> intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg , had a mean age of 69.9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
D014148_D012640 CID CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that use of high-dose <e1>TXA</e1> in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical <e2>seizures</e2> in susceptible patients .

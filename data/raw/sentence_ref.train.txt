D001971_D013610 CID effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on <e1>bromocriptine-induced</e1> <e2>tachycardia</e2> in conscious rats .
D001971_D013610 CID it has been shown that <e1>bromocriptine-induced</e1> <e2>tachycardia</e2> , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine d2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .
D001971_D013610 CID this study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish <e1>bromocriptine-induced</e1> <e2>tachycardia</e2> in conscious rats .

D001971_D013610 CID these results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed <e1>bromocriptine-induced</e1> <e2>tachycardia</e2> to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .

D011692_D007674 CID We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic <e1>puromycin aminonucleoside</e1> ( PAN ) <e2>nephropathy</e2> , an experimental model of glomerular disease .

D011692_D007674 CID We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( <e1>PAN</e1> ) <e2>nephropathy</e2> , an experimental model of glomerular disease .
D011692_D007674 CID We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( <e1>PAN</e1> ) nephropathy , an experimental model of <e2>glomerular disease</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID Therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic <e1>PAN</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID The <e2>glomerulopathy</e2> was induced by seven serial injections of <e1>PAN</e1> over 12 wk .
D011692_D007674 CID Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic <e1>PAN</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID After 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats , 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated <e1>PAN</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> animals , p < 0.05 .
D011692_D007674 CID In rats with <e1>PAN</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> , administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA .
D011692_D007674 CID We conclude that : 1 ) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic <e1>PAN</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> and 2 ) unlike rhGH , long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model .
D011692_D006130 NONE Therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of <e2>growth failure</e2> in rats with chronic <e1>PAN</e1> nephropathy .
D008315_D007674 NONE The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced <e2>glomerular hypertrophy</e2> or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis , tubulointerstitial injury , or renal cortical <e1>malondialdehyde</e1> content .

D008353_D064420 NONE There are many strategies to prevent this <e2>toxicity</e2> , including the use of <e1>mannitol</e1> as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .
D002945_D006258 NONE RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent <e1>cisplatin</e1> ; 97.2 % of patients had <e2>head and neck cancer</e2> as their primary malignancy .
D002945_D006973 NONE Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m(2 ) <e1>cisplatin</e1> every 3 weeks and those with <e2>hypertension</e2> are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .

D014700_D006966 NONE <e1>Verapamil</e1> stimulation test in <e2>hyperprolactinemia</e2> : loss of prolactin response in anatomic or functional stalk effect .
D014700_D006966 NONE AIM : <e1>Verapamil</e1> stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of <e2>hyperprolactinemia</e2> , but with conflicting results .
D014700_D006966 NONE Prolactin responses to <e1>verapamil</e1> in 65 female patients ( age : 29.9 +/- 8.1 years ) with <e2>hyperprolactinemia</e2> were tested in a descriptive , matched case-control study .
D014700_D006966 NONE RESULTS : <e1>Verapamil</e1> significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls ( N. 8 , PRL : 183 % ) , macroprolactinoma ( N. 8 , PRL : 7 % ) , microprolactinoma ( N. 19 , PRL : 21 % ) , macroprolactinemia ( N. 23 , PRL : 126 % ) , but not in pseudoprolactinoma ( N. 8 , PRL : 0.8 % ) , and risperidone-induced <e2>hyperprolactinemia</e2> ( N. 7 , PRL : 3 % ) .

C071741_D007022 CID BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions , including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure , during functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway ( FRLMA ) versus endotracheal tube ( ETT ) in maintaining controlled <e2>hypotension</e2> anesthesia induced by <e1>propofol-remifentanil</e1> total i.v. anesthesia ( TIVA ) .
C071741_D007022 CID METHODS : Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled <e2>hypotension</e2> anesthesia caused by <e1>propofol-remifentanil-TIVA</e1> were randomly assigned into two groups : group I , FRLMA ; group II , ETT .
C071741_D007022 CID RESULTS : Controlled <e2>hypotension</e2> was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of <e1>remifentanil</e1> infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil .

C071741_D007022 CID CONCLUSION : In summary , our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled <e2>hypotension</e2> anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of <e1>remifentanil</e1> during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS .

D011692_D012598 NONE Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic <e1>PAN</e1> treatment , we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where <e2>sclerosis</e2> will develop subsequently .

D016578_D006679 CID To determine whether the risk of <e2>HIV seroconversion</e2> among daily smokers of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> changed over time , we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : May 1 , 1996-Nov .
D016578_D006679 CID After adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of <e2>HIV seroconversion</e2> among participants who were daily smokers of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.57 - 1.85 ; period 2 : HR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.01 - 2.80 ; and period 3 : HR 2.74 , 95 % CI 1.06 - 7.11 ) .
D016578_D006679 CID INTERPRETATION : Smoking of <e1>crack cocaine</e1> was found to be an independent risk factor for <e2>HIV seroconversion</e2> among people who were injection drug users .

D014750_D007177 CID PURPOSE : This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company 's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone ( <e2>SIADH</e2> ) among <e1>vincristine-treated</e1> patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups .
D014750_D007177 CID METHOD : We searched the Eli Lilly and Company 's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or <e2>SIADH</e2> as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of <e1>vincristine</e1> .
D014750_D007177 CID RESULTS : A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or <e2>SIADH</e2> associated with <e1>vincristine</e1> use were identified .
D014750_D007177 CID CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or <e2>SIADH</e2> associated with <e1>vincristine</e1> use .
D014750_D007177 CID Although the overall reported rate of <e2>SIADH</e2> associated with <e1>vincristine</e1> is very low , physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event .

D002045_D010146 NONE RESULTS : The <e1>bupivacaine/rofecoxib</e1> group reported significantly less <e2>pain</e2> , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h. However , the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .

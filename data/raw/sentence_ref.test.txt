D011692_D007674 CID we recently demonstrated that recombinant hgh exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( <e1>pan</e1> ) nephropathy , an experimental model of <e2>glomerular disease</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) igf-i is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID the <e2>glomerulopathy</e2> was induced by seven serial injections of <e1>pan</e1> over 12 wk .
D011692_D007674 CID urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhigf-i treatment in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> .
D011692_D007674 CID after 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhigf-i-treated rats , 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g of body weight in untreated <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> animals , p < 0.05 .
D011692_D007674 CID in rats with <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> , administration of rhigf-i increased igf-i and gh receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of igf-i receptor mrna .
D011692_D007674 CID we conclude that : 1 ) administration of rhigf-i improves growth and gfr in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> <e2>nephropathy</e2> and 2 ) unlike rhgh , long-term use of rhigf-i does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model .
D011692_D006130 NONE therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) igf-i is a safer alternative for the treatment of <e2>growth failure</e2> in rats with chronic <e1>pan</e1> nephropathy .

D014148_D012640 CID high-dose <e1>tranexamic acid</e1> is associated with nonischemic clinical <e2>seizures</e2> in cardiac surgical patients .
D014148_D012640 CID the purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between <e1>txa</e1> usage and <e2>seizures</e2> after cardiac surgery .
D014148_D012640 CID all 24 patients with <e2>seizures</e2> received high doses of <e1>txa</e1> intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg , had a mean age of 69.9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
D014148_D012640 CID conclusion : our results suggest that use of high-dose <e1>txa</e1> in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical <e2>seizures</e2> in susceptible patients .
